From what I gathered from the project scope, this application would be primarily used on a mobile device when meeting new contacts. When I add new contacts, especially in a professional setting, the most important aspect is that I can add the contact quickly and effortlessly in order to maintain conversation. The design should be over-simplified so that the user can divert as little attention as possible to the application. 
This application also needs to open quickly with little to no loading time so that the user does not have to stall conversation. Both Android and iOS can add webpage shortcuts to the home screen. This would allow the page to be opened in one click. I would also want the application to open straight to a page to enter a contact. This may seem unconventional to not open to a navigation menu or landing page, but could save time and effort to add contacts. 
Other aspects to consider would be actually using the contact. Would I want users to be able to send an email or dial a number from the application? This is the biggest challenge with the limited scope of the project. Everyone uses their phone contacts, Outlook, or another system. This would need to either replace all functionality of those systems or integrate seamlessly. Managing contacts through multiple systems is torturous. All contact systems should be able to import export contacts as vcards. For this project, I will focus on entering the contacts and provide a way to export the contact as a vcard to another system. 

The core of my solution will be to quickly and easily add contacts during an interaction and provide a way to export the contact when it is more convenient. All decisions will err towards speed and entering contacts.
